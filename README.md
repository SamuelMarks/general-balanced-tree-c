General Balanced trees (from Arne Andersson).
https://user.it.uu.se/~arneande/ps/gb.pdf

> We show that, in order to achieve efficient maintenance of a balanced binary search tree, no shape restriction other
> than a logarithmic height is required. The obtained class of trees, general balanced trees, may be maintained at a
> logarithmic amortized cost with no balance information stored in the nodes. Thus, in the case when amortized bounds
> are sufficient, there is no need for sophisticated balance criteria.
>
> The maintenance algorithms use partial rebuilding. This is important for certain applications, and has previously been
> used with weight-balanced trees. We show that the amortized cost incurred by general balanced trees is lower than what
> has been shown for weight-balanced trees.

This codebase makes minor changes to https://user.it.uu.se/~arneande/abs/gbimpl.html in order to support:

- C23 (it broke many of the old K&R pre-C89 concepts)
- CMake build system
- Creating a library (separating test CLI into a separate main.c in its own `target`)

(whilst retaining cross-platform support in C89)

## Build

```sh
$ cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE='Debug' -S . -B 'build'
$ cmake --build 'build'
```

NOTE: ðŸ¤· paper was from 26 years ago [code most likely from 1989]â€”before software licenses were popularâ€”not sure what to
do about thisâ€¦ the author also hasn't published in decadesâ€¦ so I'll just license super permissively below and hopefully
that's ok ãƒ„
